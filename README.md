### Why study algorithms and data structures?
- They have an impact in many areas.
- Old roots, new opportunities.
- To solve difficult problems.
- To exercise the mind.
- To become a proficient programmer.
- To create computational models that explain real-world systems.
- For fun and profit. ***:D***

### What does the course cover?
*It is an intermediate-level survey course*
- Programming and problem-solving, in the context of real applications.
- **Algorithm:** method for solving a problem.
- **Data structure:** method to store information.
- The course is split into two parts, classic data type sorting and searching, and then more advanced algorithms developed from the aforementioned.

### Prerequisites
- Programming: loops, arrays functions, objects, recursion.
- Java: used as expository language.
- Mathematics: high-school algebra.
